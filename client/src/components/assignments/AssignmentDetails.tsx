        During the course, online teaching sometimes alternates with online
        guest lectures and two physical meetings at Sundsgårdens Folkhögskola.
        Together we will learn about different back-end programming languages,
        and the participants will then be able to deepen their understanding and
        sharpen their skills within the areas of web development. By the end of
        the course, the participants will have expanded their own portfolios and
        be ready to enter the job market, apply for internships, or continue to
        further education.
